# Hello-First-Timer
My first repository in GitHub. A lot of hopes here.

My wish is to learn Machine learning & Deep learning concepts and implementation
  Understanding more of SQL, Python and R will impress me a lot: My table has Excel, SPSS, STATA analysis softwares already.
  Also if i could mash up my skills in HTML, CSS and Javascript i would be happier.
  I hope to achieve this abundantly.
Getting the best learning source is a challenge.

Funny enough, i started learning C++ before anything else. Seemed hard but it helped me to get started with basics.
I loved C++ it has a great aspect of originality in coding.

If i can swallow all the above coding skills and more, i would be the luckiest brat in the world as i would be putting my creativity to action.
Too bad i have to climb the ladder.

If this is all it takes, well and good and i am UP TO THE TASK.

Some of the codes i wrote before while learning got lost when my computer crashed. I had earlier not tried github as i thought it has to be for a super coder and you have to pay for it.

Thanks goodness its free and it contains documentary on how to....

HENCE THE NEED TO HAVE THIS PLATFORM TO BECOME MORE ORGANIZED.
